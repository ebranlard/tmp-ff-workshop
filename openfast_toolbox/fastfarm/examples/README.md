# FAST.Farm Examples

This directory contains a few examples on how to setup FAST.Farm from scratch. The examples included are:

1. Example 1: Determine the spatial and temporal resolution needed for a given farm and given turbine. Uses the requirements outlined in the modeling guidances.

2. Example 2a: Create a complete FAST.Farm setup, driven by TurbSim inflow.

3. Example 2b: Create a complete FAST.Farm setup, driven by LES inflow.

4. Example 3: Create an LES (AMR-Wind) sampling input for a given desired FAST.Farm run. 

Note that these examples do not showcase all the capability of the toolbox and the user is encourage to read the docstrings. The values given in the examples should not be considered realistic for an actual simulation and are meant to illustrate the input format.
